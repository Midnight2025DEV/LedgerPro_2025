COMMIT_MSG="Fix CI workflows: Add backend setup for API integration tests

Problem: PR #4 tests were failing because CI doesn't start the backend server

Changes:
1. Updated CI workflows to install Python and backend dependencies
2. Start backend server before running Swift tests
3. Added proper health check waiting logic
4. Created api_server_ci.py for CI-friendly server (no reload)
5. Added backend log uploads on test failure
6. Proper cleanup of backend process after tests

CI Workflow improvements:
- Install Python 3.9 on macOS runner
- Install backend requirements with specific versions
- Start backend and wait for health check
- Upload backend logs as artifacts on failure
- Stop backend server in cleanup step

This ensures API integration tests can run successfully in CI just like they do locally.
